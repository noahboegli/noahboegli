# Hello!

I am Noah, a software engineer with a background in networking and security.

I work as a software engineer in the healthcare industry where I develop and manage operations of mostly web-based applications (PHP, Java) as well as some desktop applications & background services (C#, Java). Besides that, I also administrate Linux (Debian, CentOS) servers. Thanks to the wide spectrum of tasks I perform, I have a complete vision and deep understanding of the enterprise software lifecycle.

In my free time, I volunteer for [SWISS Virtual](https://www.swiss-virtual.com), a non-profit association that promotes aviation careers by replicating SWISS International Airlines' operations in flight simulators. 
My tasks in this association are pretty various, but I spend most of my time on these: 
- Developing a client software that gathers data from the flight simulator (NodeJS/C++ through electron)
- Developing a web-based platform (PHP) that acts as a crew centre for members

Given that software engineering is my main activity, I also like to take some of my free time to maintain a decent level of knowledge in networking and security. I find these topics to be particularly interesting & insightful, given their essential role in IT operations.

I sometimes work on open-source projects that are a bit more serious & business-oriented than the ones on my personal account. These can be found [here](https://github.com/gd-75).
