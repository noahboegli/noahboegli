# Hello!

I am Noah, a software engineer with a focus on maintaining a good knowledge level in networking and security.

I work as software engineer in the healthcare industry where I develop web-based applications (PHP, Java, TS/VueJS) as well as data processing applications (Java, C#/.NET). Besides that, I also administrate Linux (Debian, CentOS) servers. Thanks to the wide spectrum of tasks I perform, I have a complete vision and deep understanding of the enterprise software lifecycle.

I am a firm believer in the good impact that proper DevOps and SRE usage can have on all aspects of IT, from conception to developpement alongside maintenance.

In my free time, I volunteer for [SWISS Virtual](https://www.swiss-virtual.com), a non-profit association that promotes aviation careers by replicating SWISS International Airlines' operations in flight simulators. 
My tasks in this association are pretty various, but most of my time is spent on developping low-level (C/C++) data aquisition software for flight simulators, a client software written in Go (WebView) and TypeScript (VueJS) as well as a web platform written in PHP.

Given that software engineering is my main activity, I also like to take some of my free time to maintain a decent level of knowledge in networking and security. I find these topics to be particularly interesting & insightful, given their essential role in IT operations.

I sometimes work on open-source projects that are a bit more serious & business-oriented than the ones on my personal account. These can be found [here](https://github.com/gd-75).

If you are interested in collaborating or need consulting for a specific task, don't hesitate to contact me.
